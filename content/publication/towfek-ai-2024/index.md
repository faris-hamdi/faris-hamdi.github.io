abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) prediction can change
  education in a drastic way, where there can be both improvements and regressions
  concerning the way learning is approached. With individualized learning experiences,
  being able to spot the students who are falling behind, and customizing the course
  materials and tests that are fully customized, educators will help students achieve
  their individualized needs. We at Grand Canyon University conducted our study among
  250 students in order to find out how they are interacting with AI in their academic
  journey. Using the binary Particle Swarm Optimization - Whale Optimization Algorithm
  for feature selection and the predictive modeling Linear Regression, we came up
  with vivid findings. For example, the bPSO-Guided WOA algorithm was characterized
  by a typical Average error of 0.25934, signifying the feat it was in feature selection,
  and the Linear Regression model particularly stood out in its sustainably low mean
  squared error (MSE), with a really admirable result of 1.39069E-31. Such evidence
  indicates the remarkable ability of AI and ML methods to develop true and relevant
  forecasts by providing teachers with possible and efficient decisions, thus improving
  the standards and effectiveness of education.
