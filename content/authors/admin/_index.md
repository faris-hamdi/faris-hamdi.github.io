## About Me

{{% callout note %}}
**Open to PhD positions (Fall 2026)**
{{% /callout %}}

At SUNY Buffalo, I’m leading a project on reinforcement-guided, visually grounded reasoning counterfactual explanations for MRI. I’ve also contributed to human–object interaction (HOI) detection (V-COCO, HICO-DET). In Spring–Summer 2025, I interned with CMU’s Xu Lab, contributed to a project on CryoET volume alignment and classification (submitted to NeurIPS 2025). I’m a Research Lead & Think Tank Member with the Zewail City Computing Society (ZCCS). At DHIET, I led projects in metaheuristic optimization and applied machine learning, co-developing methods such as Ocotillo Optimization (OcOA) and iHowOA.

I’m excited to collaborate on exciting problems. If our interests align, I’d love to connect about PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.
