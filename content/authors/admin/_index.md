## About Me ==[OPEN TO PhD POSITIONS (Fall 2026)]==.

I’m an undergraduate researcher focused on explainable AI (XAI) for medical imaging, computer vision, and vision–language models.

At SUNY Buffalo (remote), I’m leading a project on reinforcement-guided, visually grounded counterfactual explanations for MRI to reduce shortcut learning and provide localized reasoning traces. I’ve also contributed to HOI detection (V-COCO, HICO-DET). In Spring–Summer 2025, I interned with CMU’s Xu Lab, running experiments for CryoET volume alignment and classification (submitted to NeurIPS 2025). Earlier at DHIET, I co/developed metaheuristics such as Ocotillo Optimization (OcOA) and iHowOA, with applications in bone marrow cytology and smart agriculture.

I’m excited to collaborate on problems at the intersection of interpretability, vision, and multimodal learning—especially where methods can be clinically meaningful and robust.

If our interests align, I’d love to connect about PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.
