## About Me

{{% callout note %}}
**Open to PhD positions — Fall 2026**
{{% /callout %}}

I’m undergraduate engineer & researcher in the Dept. of Communications and Electronics Engineering at the [Delta Higher Institute for Engineering and Technology (DHIET)](https://dhiet.edu.eg/). Broadly, I’m interested in building **vision and multimodal systems whose internal computations can be inspected, stress-tested, and trusted**—especially in the **foundation-model era**, where fluent outputs can hide brittle evidence pathways.

I currently work with **[Prof. Junsong Yuan](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jsyuan/index.html)** at the Visual Computing Lab, **University at Buffalo**, where I’m developing **Latent Visual Diffusion Reasoning (LVDR)**: a diffusion–latent framework for **interpretable volumetric visual inference** in medical imaging. Rather than producing single-shot predictions, LVDR exposes trajectory-like intermediate states that can be analyzed and reconstructed to study *how* evidence accumulates across a scan.

Previously, I worked with **[Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/)** at **Carnegie Mellon University** on representation learning for **Cryo-electron Tomography (Cryo-ET)**, exploring noise-resilient pretraining and equivariant components for low signal-to-noise scientific imaging.

I also serve as **Research Lead** at **[Brownian Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/brownian-labs/)**, where I co-founded the **Applied Machine Learning Lab**. At DHIET, I’m mentored by **[Prof. El-Sayed M. El-Kenawy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fA25haEAAAAJ&hl=en)**, **[Dr. Nima Khodadadi](https://nimakhodadadi.com/)** (UC Berkeley), and **[Prof. Marwa M. Eid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OV-YIEAAAAAJ&hl=en)** on **optimization for applied machine learning**, including metaheuristic-driven feature/model selection and efficiency-oriented training pipelines.

**PhD interests (Fall 2026):** reliable and interpretable computer vision and multimodal learning—building models with inspectable intermediate representations, principled uncertainty/abstention, and strong robustness/evaluation under noise, artifacts, and distribution shift; often leveraging generative and foundation-model paradigms.
