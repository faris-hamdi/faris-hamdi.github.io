## About Me

{{% callout note %}}
**Open to PhD positions — Fall 2026**
{{% /callout %}}

I am an undergraduate researcher in **Electronics and Communications Engineering** at the [Delta Higher Institute for Engineering and Technology (DHIET)](https://dhiet.edu.eg/), where my research focuses on **machine learning, computer vision, and Biomedical Imaging**.

At the Visual Computing Lab, **State University of New York at Buffalo**, I have the privilege of working under the supervision of **[Prof. Junsong Yuan](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jsyuan/index.html)**. My work involves developing frameworks for visual severity grading and lesion detection in MRI scans (SPIDER, BraTS, Retina MNIST) and contributing to Human–Object Interaction (HOI) detection on the V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets.

Also, I was honored to join **[Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/)** at **Carnegie Mellon University’s Xu Lab**, where I contributed to foundation model research for Cryo-electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) for developing robust subtomogram alignment and protein particle classification frameworks tackling the challenges of representation learning under low signal-to-noise conditions.

I also serve as **Research Lead** at **[Brownian Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/brownian-labs/)**, where I had the opportunity to co-found the **Applied Machine Learning Lab**. One of our labs focuses on **computer vision applications in medical imaging**, including the development of data-efficient frameworks for dermoscopic image analysis to improve early skin cancer detection in underrepresented populations.

At DHIET’s **Metaheuristics Optimization for Applied Machine Learning Lab**, I have the privilege of being mentored by **[Prof. El-Sayed M. El-Kenawy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fA25haEAAAAJ&hl=en)** (Senior Member, IEEE; DHIET), **[Dr. Nima Khodadadi](https://nimakhodadadi.com/)** (UC Berkeley), and **[Prof. Marwa M. Eid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OV-YIEAAAAAJ&hl=en)** (Senior Member, IEEE; DHIET). Under their guidance, I have co-led multiple research projects in **metaheuristic optimization and applied machine learning**, developing several novel algorithms and hybrid models — including the *Dynamic Binary Swordfish Movement Optimization Algorithm (DBSMOA)* and *Ocotillo Optimization–guided deep learning frameworks* — applied to problems in biomedical imaging, plant pathology, and smart agriculture.

**I am currently seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026 in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, and I would be delighted to connect with researchers and labs pursuing similar directions.**
