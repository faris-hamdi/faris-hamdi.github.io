## About Me

{{% callout note %}}
**Open to PhD positions (Fall 2026)**
{{% /callout %}}

I am an undergraduate ECE student at [DHIET]{https://dhiet.edu.eg/}, passionate about Machine Learning, Computer Vision \& Language. At SUNY Buffalo, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Junsong Yuan](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~jsyuan/index.html) on visually grounded reasoning for counterfactual explanations in MRI and contributing to Human–Object Interaction (HOI) detection on the V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets.  

In Spring–Summer 2025, I was honored to intern at [Prof. Min Xu’s Xu Lab](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) at CMU, where I contributed to CryoET volume alignment and classification. I am also grateful for the opportunity to serve as Research Lead and Think Tank Member at the [Zewail City Computing Society (ZCCS)](https://eg.linkedin.com/company/zewail-city-computing-society), helping to guide AI research initiatives.  

At DHIET, I have had the privilege to work under the guidance of [Prof. El-Sayed M. El-Kenawy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fA25haEAAAAJ&hl=en) (Senior Member, IEEE), [Dr. Nima Khodadadi](https://nimakhodadadi.com/) (UC Berkeley), and [Prof. Marwa M. Eid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OV-YIEAAAAAJ&hl=en) (Senior Member, IEEE). I am truly thankful for their mentorship and support, which has been instrumental in co-leading multiple research projects in metaheuristic optimization and applied machine learning.  

I am always excited to collaborate on challenging and meaningful research problems. If our interests align, I would love to connect regarding PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.
