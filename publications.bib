	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) and machine learning ({ML}) prediction can change education in a drastic way, where there can be both improvements and regressions concerning the way learning is approached. With individualized learning experiences, being able to spot the students who are falling behind, and customizing the course materials and tests that are fully customized, educators will help students achieve their individualized needs. We at Grand Canyon University conducted our study among 250 students in order to find out how they are interacting with {AI} in their academic journey. Using the binary Particle Swarm Optimization - Whale Optimization Algorithm for feature selection and the predictive modeling Linear Regression, we came up with vivid findings. For example, the {bPSO}-Guided {WOA} algorithm was characterized by a typical Average error of 0.25934, signifying the feat it was in feature selection, and the Linear Regression model particularly stood out in its sustainably low mean squared error ({MSE}), with a really admirable result of 1.39069E-31. Such evidence indicates the remarkable ability of {AI} and {ML} methods to develop true and relevant forecasts by providing teachers with possible and efficient decisions, thus improving the standards and effectiveness of education.},
